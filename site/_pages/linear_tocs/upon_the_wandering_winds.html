  <p>There are no known drafts of <em>Upon the wandering winds</em>, which was composed by the summer of 1816, when the fair copy was transcribed in the <em>Scrope Davies Notebook</em> by MWS. PBS apparently never sought to reconstruct this Shakespearean sonnet after SDN was lost, as he did for both <em>Hymn to Intellectual Beauty</em> and <em>Mont Blanc</em>, making this the only surviving version. The fair copy of <em>Upon the wandering winds</em> can be accessed below, or in the context of the notebook in which it appears: <a href="/contents/bl_loan_ms_70_08/">British Library Loan MS 70/8</a>.</p>
