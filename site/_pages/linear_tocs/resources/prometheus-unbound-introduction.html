            <div class="collapse" id="intro0">
              <p><em>Prometheus Unbound</em> was first published in 1820 in a volume entitled <em>Prometheus Unbound: A Lyrical Drama in Four Acts, With Other Poems</em> (hereafter <em>1820</em>).<sup><a href="#_edn10" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref10">10</a></sup> No poem caused Shelley more pains to compose or occupied him for so long. It took him almost a year and a half to write the principal parts of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, beginning in late August or early September 1818 and ending in December 1819. But he appears to have been planning the poem as early as March 1818, and to be revising it as late as 26 May 1820, when he mailed "two little papers of corrections &amp; additions" for interpolation into the press transcript (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:201).</p>
              <p>Although Shelley ultimately drafted <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> in parts of five extant notebooks, the only known manuscript sources for the early composition of the poem are e.11 and e.12, along with the single known surviving loose sheet of draft, c.4, f. 6r. Three of the five notebooks--HM 2176, HM 2177, and SC 546--were not used until relatively late in the process of composition: not, in fact, until after April 1819, when Shelley claimed that the first three acts were already completed.<sup><a href="#_edn11" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref11">11</a></sup> Of the 2,610 lines in the published poem, there is known draft for less than a third (approximately 800 lines)--the bulk of which consists of draft in notebooks for Act 4 (496 lines). The first three acts of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> seem to have been drafted primarily on loose sheets (possibly in conjunction with notebooks now lost or destroyed) that Shelley threw away after copying.</p>
              <p>In addition to the draft described above, a running copy of intermediate draft for at least most of Act 1 was written on loose sheets that have been either lost or destroyed.<sup><a href="#_edn12" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref12">12</a></sup> The intermediate fair copy located in e.1-e.3 served as Shelley's safekeeping copy; and he recorded in it revisions made to the poem after the press transcript had already been sent to England. In some ways, however, the fair copy might more appropriately be termed a "fair draft": several passages in the poem are drafted directly in the manuscript; a ten-line passage from the published poem is lacking in the manuscript; some lines and passages that we can infer were deleted in the press transcript are left uncanceled in the manuscript; and many details in such matters as punctuation, word choice, and stage directions that apparently were decided on in the press transcript are not recorded in the manuscript.</p>
              <p>Mary Shelley transcribed for the press most or all of Acts 1-3 between 5 and 12 September 1819, and all of Act 4 in mid-December 1819. As was his usual practice, Shelley appears to have corrected the press transcripts, making a series of small final revisions to prepare the poem for the press. It is by now a commonplace that Shelley was extremely dissatisfied with the published text of <em>1820</em>, the only edition of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> to appear during his lifetime, for which he was not allowed to read proof. But the "formidable list" of errata he prepared for that text (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:257) has been lost or destroyed--as has been the press transcript itself, which best would have reflected his intentions for the printed text. The fair copy in e.1-e.3 is thus the latest extant holograph version of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, providing a focal point for understanding the vexed textual situation of the poem. Indeed, despite distinguished work by Zupitza, Freeman, and, especially, Zillman, much remains to be learned about the genesis, composition, and production of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>.</p>

            <div class="collapse" id="intro1">
              <p>What we do not know about the genesis and composition of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> is enough to fill a book--and has already made itself evident in several. Let us look for a moment at what we think we know. The standard account, based partly on Mary Shelley's comments in her 1839 first edition of Shelley's complete poetry, is that Shelley began <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> at Este at the beginning of September 1818, completing Act 1 by early October, writing Acts 2-3 in Rome in early Spring 1819, and finishing the drama as a whole by early April, until--in the oft-echoed words of Edward Dowden--"as a sublime after-thought" (<em>Life</em>, 2:298), he composed Act 4 in Florence, in late Fall 1819. However, as Donald H. Reiman has already suggested, this account is at best misleading and almost certainly wrong.<sup><a href="#_edn13" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref13">13</a></sup> It is misleading because, as manuscript evidence makes clear, Shelley began drafting Act 4 during the summer of 1819--before he even arrived at Florence--and because the three-act poem that Shelley calls finished in early April is markedly different from the first three acts of the published poem: at the very least it is likely that over one hundred lines of Act 2 as we now know it were not written until the fall or winter of 1819--<em>after</em> he had begun writing Act 4--and it may even be argued that these lines genetically derive <em>from</em> the stylistic experimentation of Act 4.<sup><a href="#_edn14" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref14">14</a></sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>To better understand the genesis and composition of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, we need to look at the primary evidence on which the received account rests, beginning with a note published in Mary Shelley's four-volume first edition (hereafter <em>1839</em>):</p>
              <blockquote>We spent a month in Milan [April 1818]. . . . Thence we passed in succession to Pisa, Leghorn, the Baths of Lucca, Venice, Este, Rome, Naples, and back again to Rome, whither we returned early in March 1819. During all this time Shelley meditated the subject of his drama, and wrote portions of it. Other poems were composed during this interval. . . . But though he diversified his studies, his thoughts centred in the "Prometheus." At last, when at Rome, during a bright and beautiful spring, he gave up his whole time to the composition. The spot selected for his study was, as he mentions in his preface, the mountainous ruins of the Baths of Caracalla. (<em>1839</em>, 2:132)</blockquote>
              <p>The emphases of this account are clear: Shelley was preoccupied with the idea of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> virtually from when he conceived the poem in Spring 1818 until Spring 1819, "when he gave up his whole time to the composition." This accords with Shelley's own account in the Preface: "This Poem was chiefly written upon the mountainous ruins of the Baths of Caracalla. . . . The bright blue sky of Rome, and the vigorous awakening of spring in that divinest climate, and the new life with which it drenches the spirit to intoxication, were the inspiration of this drama" (R&amp;P, p. 133).</p>
              <p>Interestingly, both accounts slight the actual work on Act 1 done in Este, which might well have consisted of nearly half of the total lines for the first three acts.<sup><a href="#_edn15" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref15">15</a></sup> Shelley's own account may even lead the reader to believe that the poem was actually <em>conceived</em> in 1819, during a spring in Rome that "provided the inspiration for this drama."<sup><a href="#_edn16" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref16">16</a></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is hard to know just how to interpret Mary Shelley's claim that "During all this time [Spring 1818 to Spring 1819] Shelley meditated the subject of his drama, and wrote portions of it." Was he writing portions of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> as soon as he began meditating the subject? If it is impossible to know when meditation turned into composition and when composition might have given way again simply to meditation, it is nevertheless significant that Mary Shelley describes the process of composition for the first three acts as continuous. Other evidence, moreover, is available to help us understand this process more circumstantially.</p>
              <p>It is well known, for instance, that Mary Shelley credited the Shelleys' passage in March 1818 through the sublimely mountainous terrain surrounding Les Eschelles with "giving" Shelley "the idea for his Prometheus."<sup><a href="#_edn17" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref17">17</a></sup> And, indeed, a journal entry for 26 March 1818 in Shelley's hand compares the surrounding scene to that described "in the Prometheus of Aeschylus--Vast rifts &amp; caverns in the granite precipices--wintry mountains with ice &amp; snow above--the loud sounds of unseen waters within the caverns, &amp; walls of topling rocks only to be scaled as [Aeschylus] describes, by the winged chariot of the Ocean Nymphs" (<em>JMWS</em>, 1:200). Upon entering Les Eschelles, located just outside of France, within the Kingdom of Sardinia, the Shelleys were stopped at the border, where their books were seized by a censor, whom Shelley describes in the same journal entry as a "Priest--who admits nothing of Rousseau Voltaire etc into the dominions of the K.[ing] of S.[ardinia]" (<em>JMWS</em>, 1:200). Usually ignored in this famous entry is the passage immediately following the comparison to Aeschylus: "Under the dominion of this tyranny the inhabitants of the fertile vallies bounded by these mountains are in a state of the most frightful poverty &amp; disease,--at the foot of this ascent were cut into the rocks at several places stories of the misery of the inhabitants to move the compassion of travellers" (<em>JMWS</em>, 1:200). For Shelley, the tyranny of the Sardinian state, with its Jove-like King and Priests, is thus both figured <em>by</em> and quite literally inscribed <em>upon</em> the towering mountains--much like Prometheus's curse, which is written "as on a scroll" onto the features of the unregenerate Titan and onto the landscape of the world blighted by his curse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Shelley's personal and political responses to this particular manifestation of the sublime are thus interfused with his identity as a reader. Not only are they activated by the reading material of which he has been deprived by the State and the tales actually told upon the mountain by the oppressed populace, but they are also articulated in terms of his reading of Aeschylus's <em>Prometheus Bound</em>. Whereas it is questionable that the passage through Les Eschelles actually "gave" Shelley the idea for <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>--a work he may well have been contemplating for several years--there can be little doubt that the psychological, social, and symbolic economies of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, Act 1, were actively in gestation at least six months before he began actual composition of the poem.<sup><a href="#_edn18" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref18">18</a></sup></p>
              <p>Two notes previously unmentioned by critics may help us trace this initial gestation further: in e.1, Shelley wrote down in Greek a line-and-a-half from Sophocles's <em>Philoctectes</em> that may be translated: "unruly men become so / by the instruction of their betters" (f. 1r). We know that Shelley was reading <em>Philoctotes</em> on 2 June 1818, and it is just possible that at this time he considered saving these lines as an ironically fit motto for the lyrical drama he was already conceiving, whose purpose was, as he phrases it in the Preface, "to familiarise the highly refined imagination of the more select classes of poetical readers with idealisms of moral excellence."<sup><a href="#_edn19" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref19">19</a></sup> Another note in Greek, this one in e.12, which contains the only extant draft lines for Act 1, may be translated: "Asia, wife of Prometheus" (p. 4). The only Classical authority for the conjugal relationship between Asia and Prometheus is Herodotus, whom Shelley was reading from 16 July through 2 August 1818. It is thus possible that by early August Shelley had already conceived the dynamics of the plot in terms of the separation and reuniting of Prometheus and Asia.</p>
              <p>It is even possible that Shelley began writing the drama itself sometime in August, if he had not been sketching passages even earlier. Beginning in mid-August, the Shelleys were separated from each other for three weeks, as Shelley and Claire Clairmont left Mary Shelley at the Baths of Lucca to meet with Byron in Venice. In her often cited note to <em>Julian and Maddalo</em>, Mary Shelley states that <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> was begun at I Capuccini, a villa in Este that Byron leased from his friends the Hoppners and loaned to Shelley.<sup><a href="#_edn20" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref20">20</a></sup> It is not known when Shelley and Claire Clairmont arrived at Este, but they probably set out on 24 or 25 August for a journey that would have taken less than a day (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:34-38). Thus, if Mary Shelley is correct, composition on the poem proper began late in August or early in September 1818. Indeed, the phrasing of a journal entry written by Mary Shelley when she joined Shelley and Claire Clairmont--"He writes his drama of Prometheus"--may indicate that Shelley was already at work on the poem <em>before</em> she arrived at Este on 5 September (<em>JMWS</em>, 1:226). Hence, the long conversations between Shelley and Byron in Venice that sparked <em>Julian and Maddalo</em> were probably also the immediate catalyst for the actual composition of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>.<sup><a href="#_edn21" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref21">21</a></sup> In any case, there is no doubt that immediately after leaving Venice for Este, Shelley was earnestly engaged in the composition of Act 1.</p>

                <div class="collapse" id="intro1_1">
                  <p>Shelley probably began drafting Act 1 on loose sheets. He worked infrequently in e.12, which he had apparently brought with him to Este, drafting lines 217-18, 316-22, and roughing out a sequence of lines, which although scattered throughout the notebook, seems eventually to have become Act 1.737-88.<sup><a href="#_edn22" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref22">22</a></sup> By 22 September 1818, Shelley's most polished work on <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> was contained in the twenty-six numbered loose sheets (no longer extant) that he asks Mary Shelley, in a letter written from Padua, to bring with her from Este. And, on 8 October, he informs Thomas Peacock: "I have been writing--and indeed have just finished the first act of a lyric and classical drama to be called 'Prometheus Unbound'" (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:43).</p>
                  <p>Here we might pause briefly to consider the status and contents of the twenty-six pages of manuscript for <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>. That Shelley numbered these sheets suggests that they consisted of running copy, rather than disparate rough drafts for various parts of the act. They would therefore seem to contain, at least, intermediate draft for a large portion of Act 1. Mary Shelley did not arrive with this manuscript until 24 September, the day that Clara Shelley died. If, as the received account would have it, Shelley's progress upon the poem was halted by his daughter's death, not to resume again until March 1819 when he writes Acts 2 and 3 in Rome, then these twenty-six pages must have contained, in light of the letter to Peacock, a draft for virtually the entire first act.<sup><a href="#_edn23" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref23">23</a></sup> There is, however, no evidence that Shelley simply stopped writing <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> after Clara's death, although his progress on the poem does seem to have stalled in October.<sup><a href="#_edn24" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref24">24</a></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, in a puzzling comment to Peacock, written 23-24 January 1819, he repeats, "My 1<em>st</em> Act of Prometheus is complete, &amp; I think you wd. like it" (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:70-71). Apparently Shelley either forgot that he had already told Peacock about finishing Act 1 in October, or he had made significant additions that allowed him in January to consider the act now truly "complete."<sup><a href="#_edn25" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref25">25</a></sup></p>
                  <p>To judge from his line counts, Shelley made few substantive changes after entering the fair copy of Act 1 into e.1 and e.2. Of the final 833 lines in the act, he added a total of twenty-four lines (with the longest addition on e.1, 24r) and canceled four (see Line Counts for <em>Prometheus Unbound [link]</em>). Most, or all, of these revisions were made before Act 4 was written into e.1. A further series of small revisions in word choice, punctuation, and in the cancellation of stage directions appear to have been made in the press transcript.</p>

                <div class="collapse" id="intro1_2">
                  <p>As indicated by his letter of 22-23 January to Peacock, Shelley clearly had not yet completed Act 2 by the end of January 1819, though the rapidity of his composition in March 1819 suggests that Act 2 and possibly Act 3 already may have been started in draft. Such an inference is supported by Mary Shelley, who--as we have seen--claims that Shelley was meditating "the subject of his drama" and writing "portions of it" as they moved from Este to Rome to Naples and back to Rome again. There are drafts for approximately two hundred of the 687 lines in the printed Act 2 (and for forty-two lines ultimately unused), but much of the extant draft lines are for additions made after Shelley had already "finished" the three-act version of the poem (these are found primarily in HM 2176 and HM 2177).</p>
                  <p>For his original composition on Act 2, Shelley used loose sheets (as evidenced by the surviving bifolium in c.4) and, at least, notebooks e.11 and e.12. Interestingly, these two notebooks were used only for the first two of the five scenes in the act. The first known draft for Act 2 is in e.12 (in which portions of Act 1 were also drafted). These lines are an early rendering of Panthea's second dream (2.1.133-149), beginning "I had dreams of spring," a line that Shelley altered from "I had a dream of spring" (p. 36), thus suggesting the possibility that he had not yet sketched out what would eventually appear as Panthea's first dream. In fact, it is possible that this sequence comprises Shelley's initial sketch for Act 2, originating in the idea of a dream or dreams of Spring for which Shelley ultimately prepared by writing the transitional lines that now begin the act. Shelley changed notebooks from e.12 to e.11 to develop the succeeding lines of the scene (2.1.162-208),<sup><a href="#_edn26" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref26">26</a></sup> but returned to e.12 to draft most of 2.2. He does not appear to have finished drafting Act 2 until the second half of March 1819.</p>
                  <p>Sometime after Shelley's line counts in e.2 and e.3 were made, but before the poem was printed, 131 lines appear to be added to, and five lines canceled from, the fair copy of Act 2. The bulk of the additional lines are in three sections: 1) the "Song of Spirits" (2.3.54-98), which I tentatively date as having been written in early September 1819; Asia's song ending the act (2.5.72-110), written during Fall 1819; and the dialogue of the fauns (2.2.64-97), also probably written during Fall 1819. Thus, while it is possible that "Song of Spirits" was included in the original press transcript as an insert, the other two sections were probably the main "lyrical insertions" that Shelley sent along with Act 4 to the Gisbornes on 23 December for forwarding to the press. The press transcript, itself, apparently contained a series of small revisions in word choice, punctuation, and stage directions from the fair copy.</p>

                  <p>Parts of Act 3 may have been composed during the winter of 1818/1819, but most or all of the act was probably written between 13 March 1819 (Shelley's first known trip to the Baths of Caracalla) and 6 April 1819, when he announces in a letter to Peacock that he has finished the poem. There are known drafts only for some sixty of the 512 lines in the act, accounting for one speech by Apollo (3.2.12-17), which was written in e.12, and parts of the closing speech of the Spirit of the Hour (3.4.131-38, 142-79, 190-99), which were written in e.11. Shelley was thus drafting most of the act on loose sheets or in an unknown notebook. Because both the final speech of the poem and the first part of the Preface were drafted in e.11, we can be fairly sure that this notebook was in active use during April 1819.</p>
                  <p>Although the complexity of Shelley's line counts for Act 3 obscures any analysis of his revision of the fair copy (see Line Counts for <em>Prometheus Unbound [link]</em>), a few points are relatively clear. Sometime after Shelley's early line counts were made in the fair copy, twenty lines were added (not including one line that was left uncounted and unused) and one was canceled before the act was printed. The largest and most important of these additions is a twelve-line insert on e.3, 33r (only eleven lines of which were eventually used). These lines, 3.4.86-96, are quite possibly the latest addition to the act, meant to anticipate the duet between Earth and Moon in Act 4, and were probably written sometime between mid-August and mid-December 1819. Because their purpose is to prepare for Act 4, it is likely that they were not included in the original press transcript of the first three acts and that they were sent to the Press at some later point, possibly along with Act 4 in late December 1819. One other lengthy passage was inserted after Shelley had switched from his early count to a cumulative count: fourteen lines that were apparently drafted directly into e.3, 34r (3.4.111-24). These lines were first missed and then adjusted for in Shelley's cumulative count, and thus were probably written at about the same time he was entering his fair copy. The press transcript apparently contained the same types of changes made in the other acts.</p>
                  <p>Although Shelley claims that <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> is "finished" by 6 April, it was not actually sent to press until the following September, some five months later. Part of the reason for this delay would seem to be Shelley's frustration at hearing so little from his publisher Ollier, as voiced, for example, in a letter written c.20 July 1819 to Thomas Peacock: "As to Ollier, I don't know what has been published or what has arrived at his hands. My Prometheus though ready, I do not send until I know more" (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:103). Strictly speaking, though, <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> was not yet "ready" to be sent, since the press transcript had not been made. And the reason for that, one suspects, is that Shelley wanted time to revise carefully his most ambitious poem to date before preparing it for the press. Even within his initial letter of 6 April 1819 to Peacock announcing the "completion" of the first three acts, such a plan seems implicit: "My Prometheus Unbound is just finished &amp; in a month or two I shall send it. It is a drama, with characters &amp; mechanism of a kind yet unattempted; &amp; I think the execution is better than any of my former attempts" (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:94).</p>
                  <p>It is difficult to know whether Shelley on 6 April is referring to the completion of the draft or the fair copy of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, partly because we do not know at what stage of composition he transferred his draft for Acts 1-3 to the fair-copy notebooks.<sup><a href="#_edn27" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref27">27</a></sup> Conceivably, he could have done so at any time (or times) between the end of September 1818 (when his running draft on loose sheets represented the latest stage of composition) and the beginning of September 1819, when Mary Shelley copied the press transcript from the notebooks. But a note in Mary Shelley's journal for 25 April 1819--"Read S.'s Drama"--sets a more likely <em>terminus ad quem</em>, since she almost certainly would have been reading the fair copy of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, rather than Shelley's disparate drafts.<sup><a href="#_edn28" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref28">28</a></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Much or all of the fair copy of Acts 1-3 was thus probably written between the end of March (after Shelley resumed concentrated work on the poem) and the end of April 1819.</p>
                  <p>After Shelley completed the fair copy and after the "month or two" he originally thought he needed to ready <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> for the press extended into August, there is reason to believe that Shelley read the manuscript to friends, occasions that may have led him to make further revisions.<sup><a href="#_edn29" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref29">29</a></sup> That he did indeed revise the manuscript is implied by a letter of 15 August 1819 to Leigh Hunt, which would seem to date at least some of the work on the first three acts of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> after the death of William Shelley on 7 June 1819: "Though surrounded by suffering and disquietude, and, latterly, almost overcome by our strange misfortune I have not been idle. My Prometheus is finished, and I am also on the eve of completing another work [<em>The Cenci</em>] . . ." (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:108). At this point, Shelley finally does seem to believe that <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> is complete. In a letter to Ollier c.20 August 1819, he announces: "I have two works [<em>Prometheus Unbound</em> and <em>The Cenci</em>] of some length . . . ready for the press" (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:111). But he probably reviewed and corrected the fair copy of Acts 1-3 one last time before turning it over to Mary Shelley for transcription at the beginning of September 1819.<sup><a href="#_edn30" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref30">30</a></sup></p>

                <div class="collapse" id="intro1_4">
                  <p>Manuscript evidence makes clear, however, that a part of Act 4 had already been drafted even as Shelley wrote again to Ollier on 6 September to inform him: "My 'Prometheus' which has long been finished, is now being transcribed, &amp; will soon be forwarded to you for publication" (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:116-17). A gathering of nine leaves now located at the British Library, but originally a part of e.12,<sup><a href="#_edn31" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref31">31</a></sup> contains an intermediate fair copy of <em>The Mask of Anarchy</em> that was completed by mid-September 1819; on the back of the last leaf (f. 9v), almost certainly pre-dating the fair copy of <em>The Mask</em>, is the earliest known version of Act 4, a draft for what are now lines 325-31, the second speech of the love duet between the Spirits of the Earth and Moon.<sup><a href="#_edn32" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref32">32</a></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact is, then, that Shelley began drafting the love duet by early September 1819 at the latest, at least a month before he arrived at Florence, and, quite possibly, even earlier.</p>
                  <p>Such a fact, nonetheless, does not accord well with the evidence from both Mary Shelley's subsequent account and Shelley's letters. In her 1839 note on <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, Mary Shelley claims that Act 4 was conceived by Shelley at Florence, where the Shelleys took up residence on 2 October 1819. And, indeed, as late as 15 October 1819 Shelley was still telling Charles Ollier to publish the apparently finished three-act poem (although Ollier may have learned, sometime between 15 October and 15 December 1819, that additions were going to be made to the poem).<sup><a href="#_edn33" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref33">33</a></sup> Moreover, the earliest explicit reference to Act 4 in the extant letters is not until 23 December 1819, when Shelley informs the Gisbornes that he "has just finished an additional act to Prometheus" and encloses the press transcript (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:165). On the same day he also notifies Ollier that a new act for <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> will be arriving in England shortly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon this evidence and in ignorance of the dating established by the <em>Mask of Anarchy</em> MS, scholars have dated Act 4 as being written October-December 1819.</p>
                  <p>We will, of course, never know when the idea of Act 4 first occurred to Shelley. But there are several possible ways of reconciling the divergent evidence we do have. To begin with, had Shelley drafted all of Act 4 up to and including the love duet by early September, it is doubtful that he would have sent the first three acts off to press without even mentioning that a fourth act would be on the way. Nor is it likely that he would have taken until December to finish the rest of the act. It is possible, therefore, that Shelley began drafting some lines for what would become the love duet without yet clearly knowing how or where he would use them.<sup><a href="#_edn34" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref34">34</a></sup> He then might have begun Act 4 in earnest sometime in October, as Mary Shelley claims, and placed these lines in the appropriate place. But it is even more likely that sometime during the course of revising the first three acts of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> between April and September 1819, Shelley began giving serious thought to the possibility of adding Act 4, perhaps while preparing the fair copy for transcription in late August or early September. He could have been at work on the love duet and other sections throughout September, without being convinced until sometime in October that this new material merited addition to the "completed" poem he believed to be "the most perfect of my productions" (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:127). Whatever the exact sequence of events, Act 4 seems to have originated in the love duet between the Spirits of the Earth and the Moon.</p>
                  <p>The composition of Act 4 is rather fully documented, especially in comparison to the previous three acts. There are drafts for approximately five hundred of the 578 printed lines in Act 4, including passages and lines that are revised more than once.<sup><a href="#_edn35" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref35">35</a></sup> These suggest that Act 4 was composed in a series of four discrete movements or set pieces: 1) the opening choruses, lines 1-179; 2) Panthea and Ione's description of the Earth and Moon orbs, lines 194-318; 3) the love duet between Earth and Moon, lines 319-502; and 4) Demogorgon's closing summons and admonition, lines 519-78. Between sections 1 and 2 and, probably between sections 3 and 4, Shelley later added transitional passages spoken by Panthea and Ione; and section 2 itself is, in a sense, a long transitional passage between 1 and 3. Ultimately, the act is structured so that the intricate lyrics sung and spoken by the other characters alternate with the iambic pentameter dialogue of Panthea and Ione. Although the longest movement of the act, the love duet, was apparently the first to be composed, I have not been able to determine the sequence of composition for the other set pieces.<sup><a href="#_edn36" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref36">36</a></sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Shelley drafted Act 4 in four notebooks (in addition to loose sheets and, possibly, notebooks no longer extant): e.12, HM 2176, HM 2177, and SC 549. Of these, he used e.12 for drafting the opening choruses of Spirits and Hours and the appearance of the Earth and Moon orbs, lines 1-179, 194-318. A transitional passage in blank verse, spoken by Ione and Panthea and consisting of lines 180-93, was written later in order to connect their narrative description of the appearance of the Earth and Moon orbs to the opening choruses. It was drafted in HM 2176, f. *17r, and then inserted into the fair copy.</p>
                  <p>For most of lines 319-502, the love duet between the Earth and Moon, Shelley worked between HM 2176 and e.12, tending to reserve e.12 for his final or most polished draft of a passage. He wrote several drafts for many of the intricate lyrics in this section, and turned to SC 546 three different times to work out difficult sections (4.319-22, 376-77, 397-99).<sup><a href="#_edn37" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref37">37</a></sup> Over the course of developing lines 397-99 through five drafts, he also turned to HM 2177 (f.*21r), the only known time he used this notebook for Act 4. Towards the end of the duet, from line 457 to line 502, he stopped using e.12 (or used pages no longer in the notebook); the only extant drafts are from HM 2176.</p>
                  <p>Because the draft for Demogorgon's concluding general summons and admonition (ll. 519-78) begins in the same section of HM 2176 (ff. *16r, *16v, *15v) as the original ending of the love duet (ff. *18-*16), it actually may have been written before lines 503-518, another transitional section of blank verse spoken by Panthea and Ione, which was intended to connect the ending of the love duet to Demogorgon's appearance.<sup><a href="#_edn38" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref38">38</a></sup> However, although evidence based on the position of Shelley's draft within HM 2176 is, to say the least, questionable, it should be noted that this transitional passage was composed before Shelley wrote the fair copy. There is no extant draft for lines 539-78, which, to judge from the clean state of the fair copy, was certainly drafted elsewhere first.</p>
                  <p>In writing out the fair copy of Act 4, Shelley no longer reserved a blank facing recto page for possible revisions, as was his practice when copying the earlier acts. He simply wrote on most of the free pages available to him in e.1, perhaps because Act 4 had been drafted more thoroughly than the previous ones. An inexplicable counting error by Shelley makes it difficult to know with certainty just what was included in his count for the early part of the act, but it seems probable that a total of twenty-six lines were added to the fair copy after it was first copied (see Line Counts for <em>Prometheus Unbound [link]</em>). Of these, ten lines, 4.485-94, do not appear in the fair copy, possibly because Shelley had no appropriate place left to insert them in e.1; they were drafted, either in time to be included in the press transcript or at a later date, in HM 2176, f. *27v.<sup><a href="#_edn39" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref39">39</a></sup> The longest insert within the fair copy itself is the fourteen-line transitional section, 4.180-93, discussed above and added in e.1 on folios 7r-7v. The only other insert to the fair copy is two lines that run up the right-hand margin of e.1, 9r; they are revised in e.3, 37r.</p>
                  <p>If, as seems quite likely, Act 4 was drafted out of the sequence in which it eventually appears in the fair copy, then the fair copy itself was made after most or all of the act had already been drafted, probably in late November or early December 1819 (and the insertions to the text could be dated accordingly).<sup><a href="#_edn40" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref40">40</a></sup> As the evidence from his letters makes clear, Shelley finished the fair copy of Act 4 in early to mid-December 1819. Indeed, Mary Shelley was already transcribing it for the press by 15 December (a <em>terminus ad quem</em> for Shelley's fair copy) and had completed her work by 23 December, when the transcript was mailed to the Gisbornes for forwarding to the press.<sup><a href="#_edn41" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref41">41</a></sup></p>
                  <p>In sum, a reexamination of the manuscript evidence suggests that Shelley probably did begin writing <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> at Este at the very beginning of September and worked intermittently on the composition of Acts 2 and 3 in the fall and winter of 1818, until he caught fire in Rome during March and early April of 1819, when he brought the poem to its tentative completion--and that he continued to work on the first three acts even after they were supposedly complete. Indeed, an analysis of the fair copy in e.1-e.3 suggests that beyond local changes in words, as many as 175 lines may have been added to, and ten lines canceled from, the first three acts after they were "completed" in April 1819 (see Line Counts for <em>Prometheus Unbound [link]</em>). And, as we have seen, although as late as 6 September 1819, in a letter to Ollier, Shelley is still describing <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> as complete, manuscript evidence indicates that he had already begun drafting what was to become Act 4. In other words, the composition of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> was a much more fluid, continuous, and revisionary process than we have yet recognized.</p>

            <div class="collapse" id="intro1_5">
              <p>The Preface to <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> as published in 1820 was actually composed in two quite distinct sections, written months apart, as manuscript evidence makes clear. The first section, consisting of paragraphs 1-4, was written as fair copy in e.1, sometime between April and early September 1819, and was intended to accompany the original three-act version of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> to the press. Shelley's fair copy for over half of this section was based on drafts (possibly intermediate) in e. 11, the same notebook in which he had completed drafting Act 3. Although no draft exists for the rest of this section--from the last sentence of paragraph 2 to the end of paragraph 4--the orderly appearance of the MS suggests that Shelley first drafted it elsewhere, probably on loose sheets.<sup><a href="#_edn42" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref42">42</a></sup> Paragraphs 3 and 4 were written in a more compact hand and, possibly, a finer pen--indicating that they may have been added to the fair copy somewhat later than the preceding two paragraphs, which were probably written at a single sitting.</p>
              <p>The second section of the Preface, consisting of paragraphs 5-9, was written as fair copy in e.3 sometime between mid-October and late December 1819, presumably in December, after Act 4 had been completed. Shelley's fair copy was made from drafts in HM 2177, a notebook he used only relatively late in the composition of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>. No drafts are extant for the portion of this section that runs from paragraph 8, middle of sentence 5, to the end--a portion that, to judge from its appearance, was drafted within e.3 itself, either as he wrote the fair copy or at a later time.<sup><a href="#_edn43" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref43">43</a></sup> Thus, Shelley planned originally to end the revised Preface with, "which the unconscious passenger tramples into the dust." One part of the fair copy that certainly was added later is the last sentence of the Preface in e.3, which is written in the hand of Mary Shelley: "the pile they raise will betray <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">the spot</span> his grave / which might otherwise have been unknown" (f. 30r). This sentence (assuming "{t}he" is meant to begin a new sentence) appears in the published Preface as the final clause of the last sentence.</p>
              <p>There is little mystery about what prompted Shelley to add the second section to his Preface. His main impetus came from the notorious review of <em>Laon and Cythna</em> in the <em>Quarterly Review</em> for April 1819, which Shelley probably saw for the first time on 14 October 1819.<sup><a href="#_edn44" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref44">44</a></sup> On 15 October 1819, immediately after seeing this review, Shelley wrote to Charles Ollier that "the only remark worth notice in this piece is the assertion that I imitate Wordsworth" (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:127). He then goes on, in a passage quite similar to his remarks in the Preface, to defend himself from charges of imitation, concluding that the best poets of any age are inevitably marked by the "spirit of that age acting on all" (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:127).</p>
              <p>Moreover, as Shelley points out in his letter to Ollier, he had already anticipated such criticism in the Preface to <em>Laon and Cythna</em>, in remarks that the reviewer "was too disingenuous to advert to" (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:127). Indeed, the seventh paragraph of the Preface to <em>Laon and Cythna</em> is clearly the prototype both for Shelley's comments to Ollier and for paragraph 9 of the Preface to <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>. It begins: "I have avoided, as I have said before, the imitation of any contemporary style. But there must be a resemblance, which does not depend upon their own will between all writers of any particular age" (Hutchinson, p. 35). The markedly defensive tone of the second section of the Preface to <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, along with its repetition of points Shelley had already made in the Preface to <em>Laon and Cythna</em> (but which had been ignored by the <em>Quarterly Review</em>), allow us to date it sometime between 15 October (when Shelley saw the review) and 23 December 1819 (when Shelley sent Act 4 and, presumably, the rest of the Preface, to the Gisbornes for shipment to England).</p>
              <p>Two puzzles remain, however, involving the second section of the Preface. The first is why Shelley chose to write the fair copy in e.3, when he seems to have reserved three blank pages in e.1 immediately following the original Preface for just such a contingency (ff. 16v-17v). For this there are three possible answers: 1) Shelley believed that there might not be enough blank space left in e.1 for the rest of the Preface and he wished to preserve the new section within a single notebook; 2) the "blank" pages in e.1 had <em>already</em> been filled with Shelley's translation of Plato's <em>Ion</em>; or 3) e.3 was simply near at hand when Shelley decided to begin the fair copy. The first is conceivable. But if the number of blank pages were truly the issue, Shelley could have used e.2, which had more blank pages than either of the other two notebooks. As for the second, the <em>Ion</em> was probably written in late 1819 and could have been in e.1 already. However, in writing out Act 4, which precedes <em>Ion</em>, Shelley purposely skipped over folios 16v-17v, presumably for possible additions to the Preface. Why would he have then filled those pages with the <em>Ion</em> translation unless he had already written the additions to the Preface elsewhere? The third possibility, that e.3 was simply near at hand when Shelley decided to write the fair copy, is thus more likely than the others.</p>
              <p>The second puzzle is no easier to solve: why is the last sentence of the Preface written in Mary Shelley's hand?&nbsp;&nbsp; Again three possible solutions come to mind: 1) Shelley could have dictated it to her; 2) Mary Shelley wrote it into the safekeeping fair copy <em>after</em> it had been added by Shelley to the press copy; 3) Mary Shelley composed it as a suggested revision to the fair copy and Shelley subsequently accepted her suggestion. Of the first and second possibilities, it should be said that there are no other examples in the fair copy of Mary Shelley either taking dictation or making alterations to reflect changes in the press copy. But the first is more likely than the second, since the sentence seems to be drafted here rather than copied from a more polished version. The third possibility is, however, the most probable--and is yet one more piece of evidence suggesting the need for more study of the collaborative role Mary Shelley played in the production of Shelley's works.<sup><a href="#_edn45" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref45">45</a></sup></p>

    		<p>Far from Charles and James Ollier, his publishers in England, Shelley confronted many difficulties while seeing the <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> and the accompanying nine poems in <em>1820</em> through the press, not the least of which was getting the copy safely to London. Scholars have been equally frustrated in tracking these poems to and through the press. Without the Olliers' records (most were destroyed), one is forced to rely on the confusing, sometimes contradictory information provided by Shelley's extant letters and contemporary notices.<sup><a href="#_edn46" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref46">46</a></sup> Thus, no one has yet discovered exactly when the volume was published or how many copies were printed. Nor is it certain how and when many of the poems were transmitted to the Olliers. For many years, the story of John Gisborne's aborted trip to London with the manuscript of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> has not been explained fully, nor has the nine-month lag in publishing the poem which Shelley first urged Ollier to print "without delay" (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:163). Moreover, no one has yet elucidated why Ollier asked Peacock to revise the press for the <em>1820</em> volume when Shelley had specifically requested that John Gisborne do so. This question is particularly relevant since Peacock, who freely altered Shelley's punctuation and capitalization while performing a less than satisfactory job of proofreading, may be responsible for many of the "numerous" errors in the printed text which so disappointed Shelley (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:246). However, new facts now make possible a more complete and accurate account of the publication of the <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> volume than has hitherto been available.<sup><a href="#_edn47" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref47">47</a></sup></p>
    		<p>After informing Charles Ollier early in September 1819 that the finished <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> (in three acts) was being transcribed for the press and would be forwarded shortly (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:116), Shelley decided instead to send the drama to Peacock, directing him to withhold it from the publisher pending further instructions (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:120). Peacock, however, was unable to follow Shelley's directions because he never received the transcript. John Gisborne, who had left Leghorn for London on 12 September 1819 with the manuscript intended for Peacock, returned to Leghorn in mid-October still carrying it. Apparently, Gisborne fell quite ill in Marseilles while undertaking his land journey, and turned back toward Italy before ever reaching England.<sup><a href="#_edn48" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref48">48</a></sup></p>
    		<p>Upon learning of Gisborne's altered plans, Shelley wrote Maria Gisborne, asking her--"If Mr. G is returned" (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:126)--to send the <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> manuscript, along with the 250 copies of <em>The Cenci</em> printed in Italy, to Ollier via the next ship for England. Although John Gisborne had returned with the manuscript by October 20, either the Gisbornes delayed sending the shipment for reasons still unknown or the ship they chose was itself delayed, for the first three acts of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> did not leave Leghorn again until the middle of December 1819 (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:174). By then, Shelley had completed the fourth act of the drama, which Mary Shelley was transcribing for him. This he sent, with "lyrical insertions" to the other acts, on 23 December to the Gisbornes, who, after reading the new material, forwarded it to Ollier.<sup><a href="#_edn49" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref49">49</a></sup> Shelley mailed the only other known revisions of the <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> transcript--"two little papers of corrections and additions"--to the Gisbornes on 26 May 1820, while they were stopped in Paris on their way to England (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:201).<sup><a href="#_edn50" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref50">50</a></sup></p>
    		<p>Shelley was eager to see <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> in print. He wrote to Ollier in the latter part of December 1819, at almost the same time the ship carrying the manuscript left Leghorn: "Let <em>Prometheus</em> be printed without delay. . . . My Prometheus is the best thing I ever wrote" (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:163-64).<sup><a href="#_edn51" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref51">51</a></sup> Apparently, Ollier was ready to satisfy Shelley's demand sooner than scholars have previously thought. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the poem may well have been typeset and was perhaps even being proofread by the end of May or beginning of June 1820. About December 1819--in the first edition of Barry Cornwall's <em>Sicilian Story</em>--Ollier had begun advertising <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> as "in the press," surely anticipating its arrival. A series of ads in <em>The Examiner</em> for 5 March, 26 March, and 23 April, 1820, describe the poem as still in the press. By the beginning of May, Ollier seems to be readying the poem for the actual printing. At this time he wrote Shelley, asking him which poems to print with <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, and suggesting that <em>Julian and Maddalo</em>, or other works already sent to London, be used for this purpose.<sup><a href="#_edn52" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref52">52</a></sup></p>
    		<p>Before receiving Shelley's response, though, Ollier placed an ad in <em>The Examiner</em> for 21 May, announcing the publication of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> "in a few days" (p. 336). Also in May, he placed an ad in <em>Ollier's Literary Miscellany</em> for June/July 1820, referring to <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> as "lately published."<sup><a href="#_edn53" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref53">53</a></sup> Clearly, he expected to issue the poem near the end of May or beginning of June.</p>
    		<p>However, Shelley's 14 May reply indicated that Ollier should defer publication until the arrival of poems currently being transcribed by Mary Shelley, "better fitted" to accompany <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> "than any in your possession." These would be sent "in a post or two" (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:196, 197). Shelley's letter was received in London on 30 May and must have caused Ollier to defer publication, even though by this time Peacock may have been correcting the press. In fact, it would appear that Peacock began proofreading by mid-June at the latest. By that time, a letter informing Shelley that Peacock was correcting <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> must have been sent, since it reached Italy in early July. Thus, <em>Shelley</em>, rather than Ollier, seems to have delayed the appearance of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>.</p>
    		<p>Between the end of May and the middle of July, Shelley sent Ollier the nine poems that were printed with <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>. There is no way to determine exactly which of these poems Shelley forwarded to Ollier in May, since the letter with which they were posted has never been found. Yet some educated guesses can be made. Of the "Other Poems" appearing in <em>1820</em>, six--"The Sensitive Plant," "A Vision of the Sea," "Ode to Heaven," "An Exhortation," and "An Ode"--were written by mid-May, 1820; one--"The Cloud"--may have been written by then. Although it is possible that some of these poems were sent in letters subsequently lost or destroyed, most probably all were dispatched in a group to Ollier near the end of May.<sup><a href="#_edn54" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref54">54</a></sup></p>
    		<p>Finally, on 12 July 1820, Shelley mailed to Peacock "two additional poems to be added to those printed at the end of `Prometheus Unbound'" (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:212). One of these can be positively identified as the "Ode to Liberty," for Shelley gives Peacock permission to replace with asterisks expressions in the fifteenth and sixteenth stanzas that may seem objectionable. The other is almost certainly "To a Skylark," composed at the end of June 1820. These two poems, printed on the same sheet, appear as the final pieces of the published volume.<sup><a href="#_edn55" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref55">55</a></sup></p>
    		<p>During the summer of 1820, mail took slightly longer than two weeks to travel from Italy to England. In fact, the Foreign Post Office stamp reveals that Shelley's 12 July letter to Peacock did not reach London until 29 July. If, as seems likely, <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> was already proofread and, perhaps, printed, Ollier could have prepared the volume for distribution within one-and-a-half to two weeks, but certainly not much before then.<sup><a href="#_edn56" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref56">56</a></sup> The earliest publication date for the volume, consequently, falls somewhere between 8 and 15 August. This helps verify an ad in <em>The Examiner</em> for August 13, which announces that "Tomorrow will be published in 8vo, price 9s" <em>Prometheus Unbound, With Other Poems</em>.<sup><a href="#_edn57" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref57">57</a></sup> A weekly, <em>The Examiner</em> would probably have been accurate in an ad of this sort (though one must also recall its 21 May announcement about the imminent publication of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>).</p>
    		<p>A 14 August publication date fits well also with Maria Gisborne's letter of 23 August to Mary Shelley, which recounts how the Gisbornes have already presented John's sister Emma Clementi with a copy of the volume; by then they have even "given her a little preparatory lecture, and read some part of it with her." Leigh Hunt's 23 August letter to Shelley mentions that he, too, has already seen the published volume.<sup><a href="#_edn58" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref58">58</a></sup> All of these facts taken together offer a strong, if circumstantial, case for dating the publication of <em>Prometheus Unbound, With Other Poems</em> on, or very soon after, 14 August 1820.<sup><a href="#_edn59" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref59">59</a></sup></p>
    		<p>Judging from its current availability, at least five hundred copies of the 1820 volume must have been printed. Perhaps the brisk sales of <em>The Cenci</em> encouraged the Olliers to produce as many as 750 copies, the number Shelley had ordered for <em>Laon and Cythna</em> (see <em>SC</em>, 5:160). But most of Shelley's other works had sold slowly, and Shelley himself warned Charles Ollier that "the Prometheus cannot sell beyond twenty copies." Whereas Shelley had paid for the printing of <em>Laon and Cythna</em>, it seems that the Olliers themselves paid for the 1820 volume.<sup><a href="#_edn60" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref60">60</a></sup> And since their business was not prospering, they probably had only five hundred copies produced. Collation of several of these copies shows that although textual bibliographers from Thomas Wise to Lawrence Zillman have agreed that there were two separate issues of the first and only edition, there was in fact only one issue, in which there are at least six different states of the text.<sup><a href="#_edn61" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref61">61</a></sup></p>
    		<p>Shelley himself did not see <em>1820</em> until mid-October, when he received a copy from the Gisbornes, who had returned recently from their trip to England. The first surviving indication that he is disturbed by the printed text comes in a letter to Peacock, written 8 November 1820, in which Shelley gives thanks for his friend's kindness "in correcting `Prometheus' which I am afraid gave you a great deal of trouble" (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:244). Two days later, in a letter to Ollier, Shelley is more direct:</p>
    		<blockquote>Mr. Gisborne has sent me a copy of the <em>Prometheus</em> which is certainly most beautifully printed. It is to be regretted that the errors of the press are so numerous, and in many respects so destructive of the sense of a species of poetry, which I fear even with[out] this disadvantage very few will understand or like. I shall send you the list of errata in a day or two. (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:246)</blockquote>
    		
    		<p>From the start, Shelley had been anxious to prevent printing errors from marring the sense of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>. After asking Ollier to print the manuscript as soon as possible, Shelley urged him to send the first proofs back to Italy or, instead, hire someone at Shelley's expense to revise the press carefully.<sup><a href="#_edn62" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref62">62</a></sup> However, Ollier refused as impractical both this and Shelley's subsequent plea to have the already corrected copy sent to him for proofreading and final correction (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:178). Thus checked by Ollier, Shelley decided to accept the Gisborne's offer to read proof once they reached London on their journey begun from Leghorn on 2 May 1820. He writes to Ollier:</p>
    		<blockquote>As to the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">pub</span> printing of the Prometheus, be it as you will. But in this case I shall repose a trust in your care respecting the correction of the press; especially in the lyrical parts, where a minute error would be of much consequence. Mr. Gisborne will revise it; he heard it recited, &amp; will therefore more readily seize any error-- <em>SC</em>, 8:1021)<sup><a href="#_edn63" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref63">63</a></sup></blockquote>
    		
    		<p>Despite these explicit instructions and the letter Shelley sent the Gisbornes in Paris accepting their help as proofreaders (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:201), Peacock, not they, read the proofs of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> and the other <em>1820</em> poems. The reasons for this puzzling--and, it would seem, unfortunate--substitution remain unknown. Yet, since it crucially affected the final state of the <em>1820</em> texts, Ollier's choice of Peacock as proofreader deserves attention.</p>
    		<p>It is, of course, possible that for any number of reasons Ollier purposely ignored Shelley's instructions, or that the Gisbornes reneged on their offer. On the other hand, as noted above, Peacock may have already been proofreading <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> or have consented to do so, by 30 May, the day Shelley's directions to Ollier arrived in England. Until then, Ollier, who merely may have been acting upon Shelley's oft-repeated desire to print the poem as soon as possible, would have thought Peacock an excellent choice as proofreader, especially because Shelley himself had asked Peacock to read proof for the <em>Rosalind and Helen</em> volume. Further, the Gisbornes did not reach London until sometime between 3 and 10 June. By the time they contacted Ollier, the publisher would have seen little reason to replace Peacock. Perhaps the Gisbornes themselves were relieved to discover that this tedious job had been delegated elsewhere. There would have been little for John Gisborne to do but report back to Shelley.</p>
    		<p>Shelley seems unaware that Peacock is correcting the press until early in July. Between 2 and 7 July, he received a letter (now lost or destroyed) from Gisborne, written in mid-June, which may have first divulged this information to him. Shortly thereafter, on 12 July, Shelley wrote to Peacock: "I make bold to write you on the news that you are correcting my `Prometheus'. . . . I hear of you from Mr. Gisborne, but from you I do not hear" (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:212). Ironically, Shelley's own impatience to see the poem in print may have defeated his hopes of having Gisborne as the proofreader.</p>
    		<p>One can only speculate whether Gisborne would have done a better job of proofreading than Peacock. Almost certainly, he would have been more hesitant to alter Shelley's manuscripts. Moreover, Peacock, who was busy with his work at the India House and unfamiliar with the <em>1820</em> poems, was not well fitted to "readily seize any error" in the press. He would not have been able to spot any but the more egregious mistakes in transcription; nor did he have time to proofread the printed text with the care Shelley desired. In addition to changing Shelley's capitalization and spelling, Peacock seems to have repunctuated the manuscript heavily, sometimes obscuring complex passages where "a minute error" has indeed been "of much consequence."<sup><a href="#_edn64" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref64">64</a></sup> There can be no doubt that Shelley cared about such details: the evidence appears throughout his letters and in the few surviving transcripts he prepared for the press, which are punctuated far more closely than his drafts or fair copies.<sup><a href="#_edn65" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref65">65</a></sup> So-called accidentals, moreover, can become crucial in Shelley's texts, where punctuation is often essential to the meaning of complex passages, capitalization is used for emphasis, and spelling helps determine the sound of the verse. The "numerous" errors Shelley discovered in the volume, then, probably stem from mistakes in transcription, errors of the press missed in proofreading, and misleading punctuation provided by Peacock.<sup><a href="#_edn66" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref66">66</a></sup></p>
    		<p>On 20 January 1821, two months after voicing to Ollier his dissatisfaction with the printed text of the 1820 volume, Shelley finally sent his "formidable list" of errata that subsequently has been lost or destroyed. Because of the textual importance of the errata list, much work has gone into reconstructing it. Necessary for this process are the unauthorized 1829 Galignani edition, <em>The Poetical Works of Coleridge, Shelley and Keats</em>; Mary Shelley's 1839 four-volume first edition, <em>The Poetical Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley</em>; and, of course, the fair-copy manuscript.</p>
    		<p>Mary Shelley evidently either recovered from Ollier or preserved a copy of Shelley's errata list, from which she sent corrections for the Galignani edition to Cyrus Redding (<em>LMWS</em>, 2:86), who was preparing the text for printing.<sup><a href="#_edn67" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref67">67</a></sup> But these corrections seem to have arrived in Paris after <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> had already been printed, and were used by the Galignanis only for the other <em>1820</em> poems.<sup><a href="#_edn68" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref68">68</a></sup> In <em>1839</em>, Mary Shelley claims to have made the verbal alterations of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> from the errata provided by Shelley. But it is unclear which changes from <em>1820</em> in her text are prompted by Shelley's list and which occur because she used the flawed Galignani edition of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> as copy-text, apparently without collating against the intermediate fair copy still in her possession. Hypothetically, most of Shelley's errata for the poem could be reconstructed through a list of readings in <em>1839</em> that disagree with the Galignani edition and <em>1820</em>, but agree with the fair copy.<sup><a href="#_edn69" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref69">69</a></sup> Some of these readings could be confirmed further by Leigh Hunt's presentation copy of <em>1820</em>, which contains penciled emendations that are almost certainly in Shelley's hand.<sup><a href="#_edn70" class="footnoteRef" name="_ednref70">70</a></sup> However, at best, this is all a tentative process. We may never know the contents of Shelley's errata for <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>.</p>
    		<p>In any case, no matter how accurately the errata list is reconstructed, it could not by itself ensure a definitive verbal text for <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, and it would prove necessarily limited as a guide for punctuation. After all, without the press transcript, Shelley himself may not have been able to spot every substantive mistake in the text. Nor is it likely, given the pace and tenor of his life at the close of 1820, that Shelley even attempted a thorough collation between the fair copy manuscript and the printed volume. However "formidable," his errata list would not have been exhaustive, although it would have been a boon for editors--who almost invariably have met their Waterloo in <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>.</p>
    		<p>It would be wise to conclude this account by recognizing that the textual problems posed by <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> are virtually intractable. An edition proclaiming itself "definitive" is not likely ever to appear. Instead, we will continue to evaluate succeeding editions on the persuasiveness of their rationales, the usefulness of their contents, and the quality of their scholarship and execution. In the light of such a recognition, one can see the vital importance of Shelley's <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> notebooks. Containing the last surviving manuscript of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> in Shelley's hand, these notebooks are the necessary starting point for all those--scholars, critics, and students--who desire to better their understanding of Shelley's greatest poetic achievement.</p>

	<li id="_edn11"><p>The lines drafted in HM 2177 and HM 2176 for the first three acts were all later additions to the poem. Shelley probably saved the loose bifolium in adds. c.4 not for the draft of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> (on 6r), but rather for the prose fragment located on 7r, and titled "Defence of Atheism" by Timothy Webb (see "Avalanche," p. 2). As the list of manuscripts above indicates, there are also two notebooks, Bodleian Manuscripts Shelley adds. e.6 and e.4, with draft possibly related to <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>; and Shelley translated into Italian parts of Act 2 and Act 4 in Bodleian Manuscripts Shelley d.1 and adds. e.8.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn12"><p>We therefore cannot know if Shelley continued to add to the twenty-six sheets he had accumulated in this draft by 24 September 1818. He probably finished at least Act 1 in this fashion and may possibly have continued the running draft for the subsequent two acts.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn13"><p>See Reiman, <em>SC</em>, 6:1070-71, and <em>The Mask of Anarchy</em>, p. 2.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn14"><p>For example, the erotic song of the Earth and Moon duet in Act 4 not only crystallizes many of the thematic and stylistic impulses of the earlier acts, but also may have influenced the creation of a similarly epithalamial duet when Asia's song was added to the song of the "Voice" at the end of Act 2.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn15"><p>We do need to recall that Mary Shelley is writing some twenty years after the fact, and it is impossible to tell how much she is relying upon her own memory and how much on Shelley's statements in the Preface to <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> and in his letters (copies of which she had gathered from friends). To judge from Shelley's line counts in the fair copy, before revisions Act 1 contained 813 of the 1,867 lines in the three-act drama. For a discussion of just how much of Act 1 Shelley actually completed at Este, see below.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn16"><p>Whatever Shelley's actual motives were in so ambiguously alluding to the genesis of the poem, it did mislead more than one reader into assuming that <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> was conceived in Rome. For instance, Jane, Lady Shelley, never one to miss an opportunity to associate Shelley's poetry with Classical art and the Eternal City, writes in <em>Shelley Memorials</em>:
              <p>In the spring of 1819, Shelley wrote one of the greatest of his works, the <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>. The spot he selected for his study was that occupied by the ruined baths of Caracalla. . . . Here he worked with wonderful assuidity, and very soon completed the drama in three acts: the fourth was added several months after, when the poet was at Florence. All attentive readers of this wonderful work will agree with Mrs. Shelley in thinking the lucent atmosphere of Rome, the exquisite vegetation of the surrounding wastes, and the sublime objects of art, whether of antiquity or of later times, which met his eyes in every direction, helped the sensitive imagination of Shelley to conceive those superhuman visions of loveliness and awful might which throng the scenes of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>. (pp. 110-11)</p>
              <p>Ignoring Mary Shelley's other statements about when and where <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> was actually begun, and following instead Shelley's own lead, Jane Shelley presents a foreshortened view of the process of composition, which has Shelley writing the first three acts entirely in Rome with what would indeed have been "wonderful assuidity."</p.></p></li>
	<li id="_edn17"><p>On her return journey to England in 1823, Mary Shelley followed the same route she had taken to Italy with Shelley in 1818. After passing through Savoy she wrote to the Hunts about "la Montagne des Eschelles, whose dark high precipices towering high above, gave S--- the idea of his Prometheus . . . " (<em>LMWS</em>, 1:357).</p></li>
	<li id="_edn18"><p>It is difficult to know when Shelley first read Aeschylus's <em>Prometheus Bound</em>, no less when he began conceiving of his own drama on the subject. Stuart Curran remarks that "at about the time the adolescent Shelley finished his tutelage at Eton College and transferred to University College, Oxford. . . . Great Britain was inundated by Aeschylus," with seven collected editions of Aeschylus's surviving works and fourteen editions of the individual dramas made available between 1795 and 1825 ("Political Prometheus," p. 434). Thanks to Hogg, we know that <em>Prometheus Vinctus</em> was the first work recommended to Shelley when he reported to his tutor at University College (see <em>Life</em>, 1:70). Shelley ordered a copy of Aeschylus in 1812 from Thomas "Clio" Rickman (<em>LPBS</em>, 1:344); and, as in John Frank Newton's <em>Return to Nature; or, A Defence of the Vegetable Regimen</em> (1811), Prometheus appears in <em>Queen Mab</em> as the first carnivore. We also know that Shelley read <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> in 1816 and translated it for Byron that same year, and that by 1820 he could translate the poem extemporaneously in fluid blank verse (see Medwin, <em>Life</em>, 1:268, 2:13). For the literary and political contexts in which Shelley would have found Aeschylus's work embedded, see Curran, "Political Prometheus." Curran further argues that the chief influence on the genesis of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> was the libretto for Salvatore Vigan&ograve;'s ballet <em>Prometeo</em>, which he thinks Shelley may have read in Milan during April 1818 (see pp. 446-55). There is no question that Shelley's experience of opera and ballet played an important part in his conception of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, as has been ably argued by Curran and by Ronald Tetreault (see "Shelley at the Opera," <em>ELH</em> 48 [1981]: 144-71).</p></li>
	<li id="_edn19"><p>Of course, as noted above, Shelley may not yet have had the notebook in June 1818.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn20"><p>The primary reason for Shelley's meeting with Byron was to resolve issues of custody regarding Allegra, the daughter of Byron and Claire Clairmont. Byron made I Capuccini available to the Shelley household so that Claire would have easy access to Allegra, whom Byron had placed with the Hoppners in Venice.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn21"><p>For Byron's influence on <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, see Charles E. Robinson, <em>Shelley and Byron</em>, pp.113-37. For the influence of Byron on <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> and the <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> volume, see Neil Fraistat, <em>The Poem and the Book</em>, pp. 147-51.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn22"><p>In <em>Drafts</em>, Zillman gives only lines 217-18, 753-54, 765, and 772-79. I believe that there is an early draft of 1.316-22 in e.12, p. 52, and an early sketch of lines 737-88 on pp. 26 and 35. Shelley was away from Este between 22 and 28 September. During this time he may have been composing in a notebook such as e.12, which he could have easily brought with him.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn23"><p>Without knowing the size of these sheets, we can credit this as possible, although it would mean that Shelley wrote approximately thirty lines on each page, about ten lines more than he usually got to a sheet unless he were writing minutely--and he had no reason to write minutely. (Indeed, the size of his handwriting usually adjusted to the size of the page.) It would mean, as well, that Shelley drafted the entire first act in three weeks (rather than, say, the five weeks from the beginning of September through the first week of October), which is also possible.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn24"><p>For whatever reasons, after completing, or nearly completing, Act 1 of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, Shelley seems to have turned his attention in October towards work on <em>Julian and Maddalo</em> and "Lines written among the Euganean Hills," both also apparently begun at Este.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn25"><p>In the 8 October letter, which was written to inform Peacock of Clara Shelley's death, Shelley asked if Peacock could tell him where Cicero mentions Aeschylus's <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>. As a subsequent quotation from Cicero's <em>Tusculan Disputations</em> in e.11 (p. 115 [<em>reverso</em>]) makes clear, Shelley does indeed find out this information, quite possibly from a letter written by Peacock on 1 November 1818 (and now lost). If there were correspondence between the two on this subject, it is doubtful that Shelley would have forgotten that he had told Peacock about finishing Act 1, and therefore more likely that he had reworked his draft of the act. Nicholas A. Joukovsky, whose edition of Peacock's letters for Oxford University Press is currently in progress, informs me that there are also missing letters from Peacock to Shelley on c.29 December 1818 and 31 January 1819, which would be two other letters in which Peacock could have answered Shelley's question.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn26"><p>In e.11, immediately preceding <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, 2.1.162-end, which is on pp. 114-110 [<em>reverso</em>], is the quotation from Cicero's <em>Tusculan Disputations</em> that Shelley eventually used as the epigraph for the <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> volume: "<em>Audisne haec Amphiare, sub terram abdite</em>?" The quotation is headed "To the Ghost of Aeschylus" and appears on p. 115 [<em>reverso</em>]. Both the epigraph and the lines for 2.1 are in pencil and they are the only material for <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> to appear in this part of the notebook. We can therefore infer that they were written at approximately the same time. Whereas we do not know when Shelley learned that Cicero mentions Aeschylus's <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> in <em>Tusculan Disputations</em>, we do know that he asked Peacock for this information in his letter of 8 October 1818, and that Peacock wrote back on 1 November 1818 (see the previous Note). Assuming, first, that Peacock actually answered Shelley's query in his return letter (now lost), which Shelley received on 17 or 18 November, and, second, that Shelley would have looked at <em>Tusculan Disputations</em> shortly thereafter, we could hypothesize a date of late November for the quotation in e.11 and hence a date of late November or early December for the composition of the beginning of Act 2. This is admittedly a fragile set of assumptions, especially since Shelley could have found out about the <em>Tusculan Disputations</em> from a source other than Peacock. But, interestingly enough, Cicero would have been very much on Shelley's mind at the very end of November, when--on his way from Rome to Naples--Shelley passed near and probably visited his tomb and villa (see White, <em>Life</em>, 2:61, 81).</p></li>
	<li id="_edn27"><p>I cannot prove, either through collation or evidence from the ink, any direct transfers from the extant drafts to the fair copy--although my collation indicates that the original second scene of Act 2 (i. e., ll. 1-63) may well have been directly transferred to the fair copy. The rough and scattered state of much of the extant draft for Acts 1-3 suggests that either Shelley kept a running intermediate draft from which he made the fair copy, or he transferred his drafts to the fair-copy notebooks periodically.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn28"><p>"S.'s Drama" is undoubtedly <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, as the editors of <em>JMWS</em> recognize (1:260n); recall, too, Mary Shelley's earlier entry, "He writes his drama of Prometheus" (<em>JMWS</em>, 1:226). It is possible, though not likely, that Mary Shelley could have read <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> in the form of the running intermediate draft <em>if</em> Shelley kept such a draft for the entire poem.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn29"><p>On 15 December 1819, Shelley informed Ollier that <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> had "already been read to many persons" (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:164).&nbsp;&nbsp; It is clear from Shelley's letter to Ollier of 14 May 1820 that the Gisbornes were among those to whom Shelley had read the poem--quite possibly in the spring or summer of 1819 (see <em>LPBS</em>, 2:196).</p></li>
	<li id="_edn30"><p>There are numerous clarifications of individual letters, as well as alterations of capitalization and punctuation in the fair copy, some of which may have been made in preparation for transcription.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn31"><p>For a bibliographical description of this gathering, see Reiman's edition of <em>The Mask of Anarchy</em>, p. 5. My hypothesis that this gathering was originally a part of e.12 has been confirmed by a bibliographical analysis made by Bruce Barker-Benfield, who has discovered that the nine leaves are from the third quire of the notebook.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn32"><p>See Reiman's edition of <em>Mask</em>, p. 26. Although this ends up as the second speech of the duet, it may have been Shelley's first attempt at drafting the duet. On the other hand, Zillman believes that f. 9v contains the first draft for 4.328-31, but the <em>second</em> draft for 4.325-27, which he thinks was first drafted in HM 2176, f. *26v (<em>Drafts</em>, p. 76). The evidence, based on genetic development of the lines, is inconclusive. But if Zillman is right, then the drafts for at least the early part of the duet in HM 2176 and in SC 549, f. 140r--the latter of which is dated ?November-December 1819 in <em>SC</em>, 6:1072-73--can also be dated as written by early September 1819. Without proof to the contrary, it would be reasonable to assume that the rest of the duet was drafted at approximately the same time.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn33"><p>Shelley's earliest known reference to the "additions" to <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> is in his 15 December 1819 letter to Ollier. However, this letter refers to "the additions" (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:164) as something Ollier was already expecting, news that had probably arrived from Shelley sometime after his 15 October letter, which encouraged Ollier to "print and publish" <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> "in the season" (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:127). It is apparently not until 23 December that Shelley first informs Ollier that the additions to <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> consist of "another <em>Act</em>" and some "lyrical insertions" (<em>SC</em>, 6:1099).</p></li>
	<li id="_edn34"><p>In a similar way, Shelley appears to have drafted the opening lines for <em>Epipsychidion</em> (albeit in Italian) prior to writing the intermediate fair copy of <em>The Mask of Anarchy</em> and, hence, long before he met Teresa Viviani and composed the rest of the poem (see Reiman's edition of <em>The Mask</em>, p. 11).</p></li>
	<li id="_edn35"><p>For a complete transcription, see Zillman, <em>Drafts</em>, pp. 44-101.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn36"><p>It is likely, however, that sections 1 and 2 were composed before section 4. A more complete rendering of this sequence of composition awaits the kind of close analysis that may be available after the e.12 and HM 2176 notebooks are edited for the Bodleian Shelley Manuscripts series and the Manuscripts of the Younger Romantics series (respectively).</p></li>
	<li id="_edn37"><p>Donald Reiman persuasively corrects Zillman's anaylsis of the sequence of composition for 4.376-77, 397-99, in <em>SC</em>, 6:1072-75.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn38"><p>This transitional section is drafted in HM 2176, f. *32v.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn39"><p>These lines could have been sent in the "two little papers of corrections and additions" for <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> that Shelley forwarded to the Gisbornes, who were on their way to England, on 26 May 1820 (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:201).&nbsp;&nbsp.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn40"><p>It is thus probable that Shelley's nearly indecipherable heading on the first page of the fair copy for Act 4 reads "Act 4," with a following page number, "1," rather than "Sept 11" (see the headnote to e.1, 2r).</p></li>
	<li id="_edn41"><p>The first known mention of Act 4 of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> comes in a letter Shelley writes to Ollier on 15 December 1819: "Let <em>Prometheus</em> be printed without delay. You will receive the additions, which Mrs. S. is now transcribing, in a few days" (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:163-64). That the "additions" to which Shelley refers include Act 4 is made clear in his 23 December 1819 letter to the Gisbornes, which accompanied the completed press transcript: "I have just finished an additional act to Prometheus which Mary is now transcribing" (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:165). John Gisborne's endorsement on the letter indicates that the press transcript for Act 4 was enclosed.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn42"><p>There are drafts for the Preface in e.11, pp. 56, 58-61. Shelley may have left e.11 for loose sheets because, starting on page 62, most of the succeeding pages were already filled by <em>Julian and Maddalo</em>.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn43"><p>Judging from the resemblance in ink between Shelley's draft and the fair copy, Freeman believes that the transfer from the draft into e.3 was made almost immediately (p. 23). Such evidence is simply inconclusive, however.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn44"><p>Although Shelley believed this review to be written by Robert Southey, it was--as is now well known--the work of John Taylor Coleridge.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn45"><p>See, for example, Reiman's suggestion in his edition of <em>The Mask of Anarchy</em> that Shelley characteristically left gaps in his manuscripts that he may have expected Mary Shelley to fill, "for after his death she did insert words into such blanks in various poems, including 'The Triumph of Life'" (p. 13).</p></li>
              <!-- <li id="_edn46"><p>Charles Ollier, the senior partner of the firm and the one with whom Shelley carried on his correspondence, apparently saved letters, proofsheets, and financial records dating from 1807 to 1859. But his son Edmund, who inherited these documents in 1859 after Charles Ollier's death, destroyed in 1875 all those he did not deem "valuable," probably including the proofsheets for Shelley's poems and the record of their sales. See Charles E. Robinson's account in "Shelley, Ollier, and Blackwood," p. 185.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn47"><p>To date, the most complete accounts of the publication of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> have been given by Zillman, <em>Variorum</em>, pp. 3-10, and <em>Text</em>, pp. 3-14.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn48"><p>See Jones, <em>Maria Gisborne</em>, pp. 53-54, 59. This information about Gisborne's illness corrects the account in <em>SC</em>, 6:930, and elucidates Zillman's ambiguous statement in <em>Variorum</em> that "Gisborne's plans were changed, and he did not go to England until the following May" (p. 5).</p></li>
	<li id="_edn49"><p>In a postscript to his letter, Shelley asks the Gisbornes: "Be kind enough as soon as you have read the Prometheus to enclose it to 'Ollier &amp; Co Vere St. London.'" (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:166). Act 4 thus was sent directly through the mail to Ollier and must have arrived sometime in January, long before the ship carrying the first three acts.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn50"><p>Shelley may have possibly sent more additions to the poem on 12 July; however, the "things" he sends to Peacock to add to <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> are probably the two poems to which he later refers in the letter (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:212).</p></li>
	<li id="_edn51"><p>In <em>LPBS</em>, Jones dates this letter 15 December; Cameron speculates in <em>Golden Years</em> that it was written 25 December (p. 651). For Shelley's other enthusiastic comments to Ollier about <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, as well as his instructions concerning its printing, see <em>LPBS</em>, 2:116-17, 127, 174, 177-78, 196.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn52"><p>This can be discerned from the text of Shelley's reply, written "by return of post" (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:196).</p></li>
	<li id="_edn53"><p>I am grateful to Charles E. Robinson for bringing to my attention the existence of these ads in <em>The Examiner</em> and in <em>Ollier's Literary Miscellany</em>.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn54"><p>This establishes a <em>terminus ad quem</em> for "The Cloud" of mid-May 1820, rather than early July; January 1820 is the <em>terminus a quo</em>. Note, too, that Shelley mailed a copy of "An Exhortation" to the Gisbornes in Paris, encouraging them to show it to Hunt upon their arrival in England. It is possible, though unlikely, that this copy was used for the press.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn55"><p>No existing evidence indicates that Shelley sent "To a Skylark" separately to Ollier between the end of June and 12 July. Nor is it likely that Shelley mailed any further poems to England after 12 July. Indeed, he could not have been sure that the 12 July letter would arrive before <em>1820</em> was already printed. Cameron, who comes to a similar conclusion about "To a Skylark" in <em>Golden Years</em>, notes that both "Ode to Liberty" and "To a Skylark" are printed on the same sheet" (p. 618). However, it should also be acknowledged that "An Ode, Written October 1819" and "The Cloud" were also printed on that same sheet (sig. N).</p></li>
	<li id="_edn56"><p>For the date of the Foreign Post Office stamp, see <em>SC</em>, 8:1097. On 20 July, Shelley wrote to Thomas Medwin concerning <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, "I hear it is just printed, and I probably shall receive copies from England before I see you" (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:219). Zillman suggests that Shelley thinks the volume "is just printed" because he has seen the prepublication announcement that appeared in the <em>London Magazine</em> for June (<em>Variorum</em>, p. 7). This may be so. However, it is also conceivable that by 20 July Shelley had received word from England that <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> (the <em>poem</em>, not the volume) had been printed. He then would have assumed, or may have been told, that the rest of the poems would soon be ready for publishing. Indeed, Shelley's 27 July letter to Keats accurately predicts the publication date of <em>1820</em>: "'Prometheus Unbound' I imagine you will receive nearly at the same time with this letter" (<em>LPBS</em>, 2:221). If I have conjectured correctly (see below), <em>1820</em> was published on 14 August; Shelley's letter to Keats arrived in England on 10 August.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn57"><p>This ad was first located by Robinson, see "Shelley, Ollier, Blackwood," p. 221n. Michael Scrivener, who independently discovered the ad, hypothesizes a publication date for <em>1820</em> of 14 August, "If the <em>Examiner</em> can be believed . . ." (<em>Radical Shelley: The Philosophical Anarchism and Utopian Thought of Percy Bysshe Shelley</em> [Princeton: Princeton U P, 1982], p. 233).</p></li>
	<li id="_edn58"><p>See Jones, <em>Maria Gisborne</em>, pp. 66-67; for Hunt's letter, see <em>Correspondence</em>, ed. Thorton Hunt (London: Smith, Elder, 1862): 1:158. In her journal entry for 22 August, Maria Gisborne writes that William Godwin "has not seen the Prometheus, and does not think he shall read it through, for he hates books that are full of obscurities and puzzles . . ." (<em>Maria Gisborne</em>, p. 45). Godwin's own journal entry for 19 September 1820 shows that he read the first act of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, but apparently no more (see <em>Variorum</em>, p. 8n). Additional evidence that <em>1820</em> was available in mid-to-late August 1820 can be gained from a letter written by Horace Smith on 4 September 1820, which states that Smith received from Ollier a copy of <em>1820</em> "last week" (printed in <em>Shelley and Mary</em>, 3:535). Moreover, by 9 September, not only was Thomas Talfourd's review of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> already rejected by one of Henry Colburn's magazines (see Robinson, "Shelley, Ollier, and Blackwood," p. 200), but also a (ludicrously negative) review appeared in <em>The Literary Gazette</em> 190, pp. 580-82. <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> was also reviewed in September by <em>Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</em> 7, pp. 679-87. For more on the connection between Blackwood and <em>1820</em>, see below. Zillman, who believes that "it is almost certain that . . . [<em>Prometheus Unbound</em>] was published in August" (<em>Variorum</em>, p. 7), notes that the "<em>London Magazine</em> for September, in a notice of the book, postponed consideration until October because it had 'just come out this month', but it is quite possible that the notice itself, was written in August for the September issue" (<em>Variorum</em>, pp. 7-8n).</p></li>
	<li id="_edn59"><p>The <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> volume was eventually reissued in 1823 as part of a collection entitled <em>Poetical Pieces</em>, in which it was bound together with three other of Shelley's works: <em>Hellas</em>, <em>The Cenci</em>, and <em>Rosalind and Helen, With Other Poems</em>. This collection was issued by the publishers W. Simpkin and R. Marshall, who purchased most of the Olliers' remaining inventory after the two brothers dissolved their business in 1823. Simpkin and Marshall simply bound the quires of these four works together (complete with original title pages) and published them under a single new title page, which incorrectly gave <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> as "<em>Prometheus Unmasked</em>" and listed the Olliers as co-publishers. Enough volumes of <em>Poetical Pieces</em> were apparently sold (at highly discounted prices) to exhaust the supply of <em>Hellas</em>; and a new title page was printed for a version of the collection containing only the other three works. See Robinson, "Shelley, Ollier, Blackwood," p. 211.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn60"><p>For Shelley's publishing arrangements with Ollier, see Robinson, "Shelley, Ollier, and Blackwood," pp. 199-200. As Robinson has shown, <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> appears to have been co-published by William Blackwood: the front wrapper of <em>Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</em> for August 1820 and the back wrapper for September 1820 identify <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> as one of four Ollier publications co-published by Blackwood, with the wrapper for August advertising <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> as "Printed for C. and J. OLLIER, Vere Street, Bond Street, London; and WILLIAM BLACKWOOD, Edinburgh" (Robinson, p. 198). Although F. D. Tredrey claims that Blackwood was listed as one of the publishers on the title page of <em>1820</em> (<em>The House of Blackwood, 1804-1954</em> [Edinburgh: Blackwood, 1954], p. 53), I am unaware of any such title page. Robinson suggests that "Tredrey may have reasoned falsely from the Blackwood name used in the advertisements of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>" (p. 222n). Blackwood's financial interest in <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> and in the brothers Ollier may help to explain the relatively restrained and appreciative tone of his magazine's review of <em>1820</em>, although the same relationship did not spare <em>The Cenci</em> from <em>Maga</em>'s wrath. One might also add that Buxton Forman's copy of <em>1820</em>, now at the Pforzheimer, has two eight-page gatherings of ads (dated December 1819) for Sherwood, Neely, and Jones, bound in at the end of the book. This publishing house, which had earlier arranged to co-publish <em>Laon and Cythna</em> with the Olliers, may thus have had something to do with the publishing--or more probably, the selling--of <em>1820</em>.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn61"><p>Because copies of <em>1820</em> are classified and valued according to whether they are "first" or "second" issue, and because these facts speak to our knowledge of how the volume itself was produced, I offer the following information. In <em>The Shelley Library</em> (1886), Buxton Forman first noted that a cancel leaf for the Contents page of <em>1820</em> was printed to correct the misspelling "Misellaneous," with <em>c</em> missing for "Miscellaneous" (p. 95). In 1924, when Thomas Wise published his authoritative <em>A Shelley Library</em>, he used Forman's discovery to distinguish between two "issues" of <em>1820</em>, the first with "miscellaneous" misspelled and the second with the corrected cancel page (p. 56). Wise, who particularly liked to own (and create) bibliographical rarities, then describes his own copy, in which "both leaves are present" (p. 56). All bibliographical authorities (including McKerrow, Gaskell, and Tanselle--the last of whom kindly evaluated the evidence from <em>1820</em>) would agree, however, that Wise is describing a <em>variant state</em> of the volume rather than a new <em>issue</em> (see McKerrow, <em>Introduction to Bibliogrpahy</em>, pp. 175-76, and Gaskell, <em>New Introduction to Bibliography</em>, p. 316). Nonetheless, Wise's distinction has been echoed by Freeman (p. 6), booksellers, and librarians. In <em>Variorum</em>, Zillman further elaborates Wise's error by claiming that before the second issue with the cancel page was printed, "the <em>d!</em> of <em>wind!</em> dropped out in II.i.195, leaving: 'Asia. How the notes sink upon the ebbing win" (p. 9). He clarifies possible ambiguities in this description in a later note to the text: "in the second issue of 1820 the word is <em>win</em> with the <em>d!</em> having dropped out" (p. 192).</p>
	<p>Zillman's distinction between a first issue with, and a second issue without, <em>d!</em> is simply incorrect, as I first discovered while examining a copy of <em>1820</em> at the University of Pennsylvania, which has both the cancel page and <em>d!</em>. Moreover, it further misrepresents the printing of the volume by assuming that there were two runs of the press. From subsequent collation of <em>1820</em>, I have discovered one copy with "Misellaneous" and "wind!"; two copies with "Misellaneous" and "win"; six copies with cancel and "wind!"; one copy with cancel and "wind"; and eighteen copies with cancel and "win". I have not been able to locate a sample of the one other hypothetically possible combination: "Misellaneous" with "wind". Several of the copies that include <em>d!</em> show the type placed high and loosening from the form. From this data, we can conclude that there was only one run of the press. Relatively early in the imposition (to judge from my sampling), the type worked loose from the form, first <em>!</em> and then <em>d</em>. The spelling error on the title page is thus unrelated to the problem with the type: after the press run, the Olliers probably had the quires bound only as necessary (in 1823 they were able to offer Mary Shelley twelve copies of the volume still in quires). Sometime after several copies of were bound and sold, the spelling error in the Contents page was caught and a cancel page was printed, which was then added to the printed quires as future copies were bound. It is possible that at some point the problem with "wind" was noticed by Ollier, because <em>d!</em> or, sometimes <em>d</em> alone, have been inked into several of the copies with type missing.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn62"><p>As Donald Reiman notes, "'a revise' of a text and 'to revise' a text were--and still are--technical terms in printing, which signify, respectively, a 'second or subsequent proof' (in this case, corrected at the printshop from the author's copy) and to correct proofs from the author's copy" (<em>SC</em>, 8:1024). Reiman elsewhere remarks that Zillman's misunderstanding in <em>Text</em> of the term "revise" to mean something akin to alter freely caused him to base his critical text of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> "on a mistaken notion of Shelley's intentions" (<em>SC</em>, 6:1105n).</p></li>
	<li id="_edn63"><p>I quote from <em>SC</em> because of an error in <em>LPBS</em> that garbles the text (2:196). Robinson believes it likely that Shelley's "be it as you will" signals Shelley's acceptance of an offer by Ollier to print <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> at Ollier's own expense, as had been done with <em>Rosalind and Helen</em> (see "Shelley, Ollier, and Blackwood," p. 200). Within this same letter to Ollier, Shelley alludes to his unpaid debt to the printer Carew Henry Reynell, who had already printed Percy and Mary Shelley's <em>History of a Six Weeks' Tour</em> (1817), as well as Shelley's <em>A Proposal for Putting Reform to the Vote</em> (1817) and <em>Rosalind and Helen</em> (1819). As Reiman speculates, Shelley's unpaid debt to Reynell may have led him to refuse to print <em>1820</em>, with significant consequences for the final state of the text: "That <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> was printed by [William] Marchant instead of Reynell (who was probably familiar with Shelley's and Mary Shelley's handwriting and with Shelley's specifications for following copy exactly) certainly must have added to the number of errors" (<em>SC</em>, 8:1024).</p></li>
	<li id="_edn64"><p>The punctuation of <em>1820</em> more closely resembles Peacock's characteristic patterns than those evident in Shelley's press transcripts or in the printed poems Shelley saw through the press, such as the first edition of <em>The Cenci</em> and <em>Adonais</em>. The precise nature of the changes Peacock made in the punctuation and capitalization of Shelley's press transcript can, of course, only be conjectured. However, for this purpose I have found at the Bodleian Library what may be a useful piece of evidence: a holograph entitled "Ode for Music," prepared for the press or for presentation as a gift by Shelley (Bodleian MS. Montagu d.18). "Ode for Music" turns out to be another version of the poem appearing in <em>1820</em> as "An Ode, Written in October 1819, Before the Spaniards had Recovered their Liberty," although the former contains an additional stanza at the end. Collation between the congruent portions of "Ode for Music" and the text in <em>1820</em> reveals forty-four differences in so-called "accidentals" within thirty-five lines. If we assume that Shelley would have punctuated the press copy of <em>1820</em> much as he does the "Ode for Music" (a proposition by no means certain), then these differences could be summarized as follows: Peacock seems to have lower-cased and regularized Shelley's capitals, eradicated Shelley's dashes, deleted a few of Shelley's commas while liberally adding his own, inserted a number of colons, and, in general, increased Shelley's own punctuation throughout. These findings confirm Forman's claim that Peacock is said to have "spoken of removing Shelley's frequent dashes when revising for the press" (<em>Shelley Library</em>, p. 88). They also agree with Chernaik's examination of the texts in the <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> and the <em>Rosalind and Helen</em> volumes, which suggests "a consistent regularization of Shelley's text, in which capitals and dashes are removed and, in some cases, forms altered ('are' for 'art,' 'among' for 'amongst' in 'Hymn to Intellectual Beauty')" (<em>Lyrics</em>, pp. xv-xvi).</p></li>
	<li id="_edn65"><p>In the first published description of the fair copy of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, Mathilde Blind describes it as "always carefully punctuated" (p. 80). Zillman, on the other hand, finds the punctuation of the manuscript sporadic and inconsistent:</p>
	<p>if present, [it] is frequently careless, even where (as at III.iii.40-62) the sentence structure is complex and the sense difficult to determine; or it is altered, leaving an ambiguity to plague the transcriber; or it is eccentric. But perhaps the overriding habit in this regard is found at line ends or line breaks. Except for the question mark, which he used with some consistency, the poet was quite likely to omit any pointing, or to indulge his favorite substitute, the dash, which he used in place of normally expected punctuation. (<em>Text</em>, p. 7)</p>
	<p>In fact, the punctuation of the fair copy is neither as careful as Blind submits or as erratic as Zillman claims. Zillman misses punctuation in the fair copy, especially punctuation that was lightly penciled in at the end of lines. But much of what seems merely erratic to Zillman is due to the by now well-documented fact that Shelley, like many other poets of his day, punctuated his poems rhetorically rather than grammatically (see, for example, R&amp;P, pp. xiv-xv). Thus, in place of what Zillman calls "normally expected punctuation," Shelley's punctuation is designed to show readers where he wanted a break in phrasing--and for how long (see the manual of contemporary rhetoric quoted in R&amp;P for the length of pause assigned to each punctuation mark [p. xiv]). Moreover, in so punctuating, Shelley frequently let the line break stand for a brief pause in place of a comma, or he sometimes used a comma at the line break where the "normally expected punctuation" would be a semi-colon or a colon. Nonetheless, the fair copy is certainly not as closely punctuated as Shelley's known press transcripts and the volumes he supervised through the press in Italy. No doubt, as was apparently her custom, Mary Shelley added and revised punctuation as she transcribed the press transcript for <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>. But in such cases, Shelley appears to have carefully checked the transcription, correcting punctuation and capitalization as he thought necessary (see, for example, his corrections on the press transcript of <em>The Mask of Anarchy</em> in Reiman's photofacsimile edition, pp. 40-51).</p></li>
	<li id="_edn66"><p>To be fair to Peacock, it should be said that even in transcripts for the press Shelley sometimes omitted necessary punctuation--including periods--from the end of lines. As proofreader of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, Peacock would have been forced to add pointing to Shelley's text where needed, a decision that would have been especially difficult to make in the most ambiguous passages. Given Shelley's reaction when he discovered that he would not be allowed to read proof for <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, perhaps the most important point to make here is that Shelley was hoping that his press transcript would be followed closely by the printers <em>even</em> if it contained omissions and errors. As Reiman points out, he "was more willing to risk errors attributable to his manuscript (as he had in the case of <em>Laon and Cythna</em>) than to sanction random changes by compositors--particularly when such changes might affect the rhythm of his lyrics" (<em>SC</em>, 6:1105).</p></li>
	<li id="_edn67"><p>It is possible that Mary Shelley wrote the errata into a copy of <em>1820</em> that eventually came into the possession of Harry B. Smith, who laments: "The glory of this copy has departed. When it came into the possession of the present owner it was soiled and in poor condition, but it contained manuscript notes by Mary Shelley. In an evil hour it was sent to be bound, and in the process of cleaning the manuscript notes were neatly removed" (<em>A Sentimental Library</em> [privately printed, 1914], p. 187).</p></li>

	<li id="_edn69"><p>Such an attempt is made by Zillman, who arrives at a probable list of twenty-nine readings, p. 19.</p></li>
	<li id="_edn70"><p>Leigh Hunt's presentation copy of <em>1820</em>, currently at the Huntington Library (cat. no. 22460), was unknown to Zillman and previous editors of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>. This copy, first mentioned by Chernaik, has fourteen corrections in pencil to the poems (Chernaik found twelve), all of which she believes were based upon the errata list, although she does not actually identify the hand in which they are written (<em>Lyrics</em>, p. xvi). My own examination of the evidence indicates that the corrections were almost certainly written in Shelley's hand, although the inscription in black ink on the inside cover is actually by Hunt himself. Whereas there is probably no direct connection between the corrections in Hunt's copy of <em>1820</em> and the errata list itself, Shelley would have had to have written the corrections just before he died in early July 1822, the only time he was ever again to see Hunt in person. The corrections are obviously not exhaustive, nor do they mark the most glaring errors in <em>1820</em>. Apparently, then, Shelley wrote them as he quickly skimmed through the book, but with some memory of the errata. Because they have not yet been published elsewhere, I include below the six corrections to <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>: 1) at 1.152, an "X" is faintly penciled in the left margin, referring presumably to the positioning of the dialogue on the page; 2) 2.5.54, "limbs" is substituted for "lips"; 3) 3.4.194, a semi-colon is added after "but man"; 4) 3.4.198, a question mark is substituted for the semi-colon after "Passionless"; 5) 4.274, <em>e</em> in "spoke" is marked to indicate the need for a following <em>s</em>, which Shelley placed in the right-hand margin; 6) 4.282, "poized" is substituted for the canceled "poured." In addition, "thee" is underlined in "behold thee" (2.5.60), perhaps to show the need for italics. I am grateful to Stuart Curran, who first brought the Hunt presentation copy to my attention.</p></li>
