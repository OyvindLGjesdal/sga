  <div class="intro-text"><p>The virtually reconstituted Notebook A is one of two now disbound notebooks in which Mary W. Shelley (MWS) drafted the two-volume version of <em>Frankenstein</em>. Probably purchased in Geneva, the notebook contained draft running from the midst of Volume I, Chapter 1 to the end of the fifth chapter of Volume II, which concludes Safie’s history. This draft was written between August and early December 1816, according to Charles E. Robinson’s <a href="/contents/frankenstein/frankenstein-chronology/"><em>Frankenstein Chronology</em></a> with revisions as late as the end of April 1817. 
</p><p>
  The disbound Notebook A now consists of 77 loose leaves comprising all of Bodleian <a href="/contents/ms_abinger_c56">MS. Abinger c.56</a> (formerly designated Dep. 477/1) and Bodleian <a href="/contents/ms_abinger_c57">MS. Abinger c.57</a> (formerly designated Dep. 534/1), folios 1-18r. Detailed information about its bibliographical details, including paper, watermarks, inserts, and quiring charts, can be found in Charles E. Robinson’s <a href="/contents/frankenstein/the-frankenstein-notebooks-introduction/"><em>The</em> Frankenstein <em>Notebooks</em>, pp. xxxv-xl</a>. For the S-GA overview of the composition of <em>Frankenstein</em>, see our <a href="/contents/frankenstein/">Introduction</a>.
