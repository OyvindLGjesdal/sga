  <div class="intro-text"><p>Bodleian MS Abinger c.58 (formerly designated Dep. 534/2) consists of 30 leaves, 18 of which were originally bound in <a href="/contents/frankenstein_notebook_c1">Notebook C1</a> and 12 of which were originally bound in <a href="/contents/frankenstein_notebook_c2">Notebook C2</a>, the two extant notebooks in which the Shelleys prepared fair copy for a three-volume version of <em>Frankenstein</em> to send prospective publishers and, ultimately, the printer. It begins with Volume III, Chapter 5 and ends in Chapter 8, almost at the conclusion of the novel, in the midst of the Creature’s final speech to Walton. This fair copy was written sometime between mid-April and late May 1817, according to Charles E. Robinson’s <a href="/contents/frankenstein/frankenstein-chronology"><em>Frankenstein Chronology</em></a>.</p>

<p>The pages of c.58 can be accessed in three different sequences: (1) in their current physical sequence below; (2) in their order within a virtually reconstituted <a href="/contents/frankenstein_notebook_c1">Notebook C1</a> and <a href="/contents/frankenstein_notebook_c2">Notebook C2</a>; and (3) in the <a href="/contents/frankenstein/#oxford_frankenstein_volume_iii">linear sequence</a> of the three-volume fair copy. For bibliographical details about c.58, see the introductions to <a href="/contents/frankenstein_notebook_c1">Notebook C1</a> and <a href="/contents/frankenstein_notebook_c2">Notebook C2</a>. For the S-GA overview of the composition of Frankenstein, see our <a href="/contents/frankenstein/">Introduction</a>.</p></div>
