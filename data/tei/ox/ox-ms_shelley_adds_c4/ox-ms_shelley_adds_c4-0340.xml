    <line>a delicacy &amp; simplicity in his manners inexpressibly</line>
    <line>attractive. <del rend="strikethrough">By some strange fortune</del> It has never been</line>
    <line>my fortune to meet with him since our school boy days</line>
    <line>but either I confound my present recollections with the</line>
    <line><del rend="strikethrough">il</del> delusions of past feelings, or he is now <del rend="strikethrough">an honourab</del></line>
    <line>a source of honour &amp; utility to every one around him.</line>
    <line>The tones of his voice were so soft &amp; winning, that every</line>
    <line>word p<del rend="strikethrough">e</del>ierced into my heart, &amp; their pathos was so</line>
    <line>deep that in listening to him the tears have often</line>
    <line>in voluntarily gushed from my eyes. Such was the</line>
    <line>being for whom I fi<unclear></unclear>rst experienced the sacred sentiment</line>
    <line>of friendship. I remember in my simplicity writing</line>
    <line>to my mother a long account of his admirable</line>
    <line>qualities &amp; my own devoted attachment. I suppose</line>
    <line>she thought me out of my wits, for she returned no</line>
    <line>answer to my letter. I remember we used to walk</line>
    <line>by</line>
    <line>the whole play hours up &amp; down some moss covered</line>
    <line>palings pouring out our hearts in youthful talk. We</line>
    <line>used to speak of the ladies with whom we were</line>
    <line>in love, &amp; I remember that our usual practise was</line>
    <line>to confirm each other in the everlasting fidelity</line>

    <line>each other. I recollect thinking my friend ex<del rend="strikethrough">quisitely</del></line>
    <line>-quisitely beautiful. Every night when we parted</line>
    <line>too</line>
    <line>to go to bed I remember that we kissed each other.</line>
